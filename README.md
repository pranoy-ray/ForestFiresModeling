# Forest Fire Simulation Using PDE & ABM

Implementations of the forest fire model with PDE & ABM methods:

1. PDE: Partial Differential Equation
2. ABM: Agent-Based Modeling

# Directory Structure

All the files are located in the 'Project/' directory. The overall structure is the following:

* 'Project/CSE_6730_FinalReport.pdf' is the written proposal for this project.
* 'Project/PDE/Final Version/forest_fire_PDE_final_version.ipynb': Shows the model and results in a notebook. (It generates Figures 4, 5, 6, 7 inthe  Final Report)
* 'Project/PDE/Final Version/forest_fire_PDE_final_version_for_results_analysis.ipynb': Shows the model and results in a notebook. (It generates Figure 9, 11, and Table 1 in the Final Report)
# Running PDE

The main script is 'PDE/Final Version/forest_fire_PDE_final_version.ipynb', and you can run it in Jupyter Notebook.

# Running ABM

The main script is 'ABM/ABM.ipynb', and you can run it in Jupyter Notebook.
